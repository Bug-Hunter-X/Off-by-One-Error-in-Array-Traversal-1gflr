This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java array traversal. The `bug.java` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.java` provides the corrected version.  The error arises from an incorrect loop condition that attempts to access an element beyond the array's bounds.  This example highlights the importance of careful loop condition management when working with arrays in Java.
